Hello. My name is Ben Welsh. I'm an Iowan living in New York City.

I am a reporter, an editor and a computer programmer. My job is to use those skills, together, to find and tell stories.

I work at [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), the world's largest multimedia news provider, where I founded the organization's News Applications Desk. In that role, I lead the development of dashboards, databases and automated systems that benefit clients, inform readers, empower reporters and serve the public interest.

Examples of our work include a [mapping platform designed for data journalism](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7378398717877383168/), [an AI assistant trained at chart-making](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391131110631620608/) and [a fleet of automated pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfhEPdBBUU) that enrich stories and routinely [lead the homepage](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369731190469070863/) by producing graphics covering [markets](https://www.reuters.com/data/magnificent-seven-monitor-2024-10-30/), [economics](https://www.reuters.com/data/tracking-trumps-economy-2025-01-27/), [public opinion](https://www.reuters.com/data/trumps-approval-rating-2025-01-21/) and extreme weather.

I am also a teacher. I am currently appointed as an [adjunct professor](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/faculty/ben-welsh/) at The City University of New York's [graduate school of journalism](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/), where [I equip students with technical skills](https://palewi.re/docs/coding-the-news/) to increase the rigor and reach of their reporting. And I'm a founding faculty member of [a new master's degree program in data visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393989801105895424/) offered by the [School of Visual Arts](https://sva.edu/), which will welcome a first class to its Manhattan campus in fall 2026.

Projects I've contributed to have been recognized by the [Pulitzer Prizes](https://web.archive.org/web/20240428184652/https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/los-angeles-times-staff), the [Library of Congress' Innovation Award](https://web.archive.org/web/20231004223935/https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2015/10/announcing-the-2015-innovation-award-winners/), [Harvard's Bingham Prize](https://web.archive.org/web/20230924155942/https://nieman.harvard.edu/news/2012/03/los-angeles-times-wins-bingham-prize-for-billions-to-spend/), the [Reuters Journalists of the Year Awards](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7312825918555578368/), [Investigative Reporters and Editors](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7350492151794831361/), the [Knight Foundation's News Challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20250119005947/https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2015/07/22/knight-news-challenge/) and [numerous other commendations](#honors) for investigative reporting, digital design and online journalism.

Before Reuters, I spent 15 years at the Los Angeles Times. I co-founded The Times' first digitally-focused projects team and went on to lead the [modernization of the newspaper's graphics department](https://www.latimes.com/about/pressreleases/story/2019-08-16/ben-welsh-to-lead-a-unified-data-and-graphics-department). In those roles, I helped to create the most popular pages in the history of [latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/), including the site's first live election results, [a mapping platform](http://maps.latimes.com) that set a new standard for defining L.A. neighborhoods, custom designs for dozens of flagship projects, an award-winning [wildfire tracker](https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/) and the most complete resource on the spread of [COVID-19](https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/) in California.

Earlier in my career, I worked on investigative projects at [The Center for Public Integrity](https://www.publicintegrity.org) and helped produce long-form documentaries for cable channels like CNN. For three years, I served as a fellow at DePaul University's [Center for Journalism Integrity & Excellence](https://web.archive.org/web/20211117121654/https://communication.depaul.edu/about/news-and-events/2021/Pages/ben-welsh-cjie-fellow.aspx), where I partnered with faculty to inspire and prepare future reporters. I spent a year as a visiting journalist at Stanford University, where I led [an expansion of the Big Local News initiative](https://web.archive.org/web/20220105151537/https://www.latimes.com/about/pressreleases/story/2021-12-16/ben-welsh-to-lead-new-data-journalism-partnership-with-stanford).

My data-driven reporting has led to [reforms](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lafd-budget-20140415-story.html#nt=outfit) in the Los Angeles Fire Department's 911 system, overhauls to how the city [recruits](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lafd-hiring-follow-20151117-story.html#nt=outfit) and [hires](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-lafd-20140321,0,6241555.story) firefighters, a revamp of a [broken building inspection program](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-city-leaders-call-for-lafd-to-step-up-fire-inspections-20150616-story.html), the [replacement](https://www.latimes.com/la-mew-crime-map-errors-story.html) of the Los Angeles Police Department's public crime map, as well as [increased](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-long-beach-renter-vote-20150602-story.html) fines against exploitative landlords. As a result, two city [fire](http://articles.latimes.com/print/2013/oct/10/local/la-me-1011-lafd-chief-20131011) [chiefs](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-compton-fire-chief-20150707-story.html) and the [Los Angeles fire marshal](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-lafd-fire-marshal-out-20160823-snap-story.html#nt=outfit) have left office.

I'm a code contributor to many open-source software projects, including [Project Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [IPython](https://ipython.org/), [Observable](https://github.com/observablehq/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/). I've led [the development](https://github.com/palewire) of dozens of tools that ease access to data published by U.S. government agencies, including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and an array of wildfire tracking systems.

My open-source experimentation with [digital archiving tools](http://www.pastpages.org/) has generated a growing collection of [news homepages](https://homepages.news) at the Internet Archive, a [personalized clipping service](http://savemy.news/) that empowered journalists to preserve their work, an [E.E. Cummings poetry collection](https://cummings.ee/), a [dictionary of political fundraising jargon](https://moneyinpolitics.wtf/), [a podcast](https://studs.show/) celebrating the legacy of Studs Terkel, social media bots that promote collections at the [Los Angeles Public Library](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@oldlaphotos) and the [Library of Congress](https://mastodon.palewi.re/@sanbornmaps), as well as [a series](https://pastpages.org/) of software packages that allow programmers to archive born-digital material more easily.

As a co-founder of the [California Civic Data Coalition](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/about/), I helped open up the jumbled, difficult database tracking campaign finance and lobbying activity in state politics. That work resulted in [improved](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-antonio-villaraigosa-charter-school-money-governor-20180514-story.html) [coverage](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658358/vape-lobby-vaping-health-risks-nicotine-big-tobacco-marketing) [of](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-newsom-cannabis-20170727-story.html) [the topic](https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-brown-money-20141031-story.html), including some of the most [comprehensive](https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/) and [probing](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-san-francisco-money/) analysis ever done of money at the statehouse. The coalition's effort yielded a [groundbreaking tool](https://www.californiacivicdata.org/2017/09/05/django-postgres-copy-2/) for database imports and [data journalism curriculum](https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/about/index.html) that has been taught in classrooms and conferences around the world.

I frequently teach practical computer programming skills to journalism students and professionals. That includes creating [online](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029105852/https://journalismcourses.org/PDJ0517.html) [courses](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522034836/https://journalismcourses.org/product/first-python-notebook-data-analysis-on-deadline/) at the University of Texas, leading training sessions for my work colleagues and at journalism conferences, streaming [free classes](https://palewi.re/posts/2021/02/23/nicar21-after-party-first-python-notebook/) online, and serving as a guest instructor at [Stanford](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/960521283237707776), the [University of California Los Angeles](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1325210597768622080), the [University of California Santa Cruz](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1130481885300215808), the [University of California San Diego](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/782313974465302528), [California State University Northridge](https://twitter.com/jretis/status/642380347804618752), the [University of Southern California](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1109162299158196225), The New School, [Arizona State University](https://twitter.com/palewire/status/1396537050292056064), American University and [DePaul University](https://twitter.com/LATimesFreshInk/status/856521234175057921).
